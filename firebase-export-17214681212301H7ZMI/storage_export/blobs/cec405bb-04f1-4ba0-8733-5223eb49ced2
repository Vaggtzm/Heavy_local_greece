{"content":"<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">From the heart of Ukraine emerges Lethargy, a metal band whose journey traverses over seventeen years of relentless passion and unyielding dedication. United by their love for the genre, the members of Lethargy reflect on their evolution from students to seasoned musicians, navigating through discord and disagreement to emerge stronger and more unified. As they stand on the cusp of their latest album release, “Our Life Belongs to Us”, Lethargy’s story intertwines with the tumultuous narrative of their homeland, Ukraine, showcasing not just their musical prowess but their role as ambassadors of resilience and solidarity in the face of adversity.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>:<strong> </strong>Hello and welcome! It’s truly delightful to have you join us! What initially drew each of you to metal music, and how did you come together to form Lethargy?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: Hello from Ukraine! We’re very excited to tell you about ourselves. What brought us all together was our love for metal music. That’s why we formed the band while we were still students. I can’t say that our tastes align 100%, but for the most part, we’re together because of our sense of responsibility and serious attitude towards our passion.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><em>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</em></strong><em>:</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Were there any shared musical influences or experiences that solidified your bond as a band?</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lethargy UA</em></strong><em>: Yes, we like My Dying Bride, In Flames, Insomnium. These three bands are liked by all the members of Lethargy.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: As a band that has been active for over a decade, how do you maintain camaraderie and creativity within the group?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: Thank you for the question. That’s right, it’s been 17 years for us. Sometimes we just can’t believe that the band has been around for so long. I’ll be honest with you: Lethargy could have broken up 20 times, but some unknown force wants us to continue. We no longer lead the band; the band leads us. We’ve been through a lot as musicians and as friends. There were disagreements, quarrels, times when we didn’t speak for years. But now we’ve passed through all those childish stages and don’t pay attention to our emotions. After all, they hinder moving forward collectively. Do you agree?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>:<strong> </strong>What do you consider to be the defining moments or turning points in your journey together, both personally and as musicians?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: A pivotal moment for me personally was the move to Zaporizhia, where I formed the band. And then the move to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Another significant event at the beginning of our career was performing together with the band Draconian. And on our current album, Aaron Stainthorpe from My Dying Bride sang.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>:<strong> </strong>Lethargy’s music incorporates elements of atmospheric doom and death metal, with a distinct Slavonic flair. What are some of the key influences—musical, cultural, or otherwise—that have shaped your unique sound over the years?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: I don’t know where you heard the Slavic flair. Except maybe on the first three albums, where I sang in Russian, but then switched to English. This happened even before the war. And our unique sound is created by our sound engineer, with whom we’ve been working for over 10 years. It’s Anton Vorozhtsov from TA Production. He plays in the well-known Ukrainian band Hell:On.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: As artists hailing from Ukraine, how does your cultural heritage inform your creative process and lyrical themes?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: We are more inspired by the music of our favorite bands. But when it comes to the influence of our country on our music, it’s now unified for everyone - it’s the war.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><em>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</em></strong><em>: In what ways do you seek to represent your homeland through your music, particularly in the light of current socio-political challenges?</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lethargy UA</em></strong><em>: When the war started, I cut off all ties with Russia. Previously, we interacted, and I had to deal with Russians on business-related musical matters, and we were popular there at one time. But when the war began, I cut off all ties with them, of course. And I started to communicate more with European people. Now, 80% of our listeners and customers of our merchandise are foreigners. That’s how we represent our music.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: With your roots in Zaporizhia and later relocating to Kyiv, how has your sense of identity as a band evolved over the years?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: If earlier we were identified as a Zaporizhia band, now we are identified as a Kyiv band. And for foreign listeners, we are simply a Ukrainian band.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><em>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</em></strong><em>: How do you navigate the cultural dynamics of both regions within your music?</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lethargy UA</em></strong><em>: The move of the band to Kyiv has influenced a more quality-oriented approach to music-making. We retained the enthusiasm from Zaporizhia and acquired a more quality-focused approach in the capital.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: Lethargy’s discography showcases a progression of sound and style, from your early demos to your latest album, “Our Life Belongs to Us”. Looking back, how do you perceive the evolution of your music, and what are some key lessons you’ve learned along the way?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: As I’ve mentioned in previous answers, the key moments were the two relocations for me and one for my bandmates. And of course, the fact that from the second album onwards, we started working with a top-notch sound engineer.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: Are there any specific moments or albums in your discography that you feel particularly proud of or that hold special significance to the band?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: We are satisfied with all the albums. Right now, it seems to us that “Our Life Belongs to Us” is the best. Firstly, it’s the first album in the history of the band where all the band members were involved in the composition. But there is one album in our discography that was a turning point. It involves other musicians, and the style itself differs from the classic Lethargy. That’s the third album, “Epoch of Evil.” This album may have lost us some loyal listeners, but it also attracted new ones.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: “Our Life Belongs to Us” has been hailed as a testament to Lethargy’s resilience and growth. Among your extensive catalog, where does this album stand for you personally?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: It takes the first place.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: How do you interpret the evocative artwork of “Our Life Belongs to Us”, and what emotions or themes does it stir within you as both creators and listeners?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: This album touches upon three narrative lines: war, family, and God.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: How do you perceive the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine impacting the metal music scene, both in terms of artistic expression and the experiences of fans and artists within the country?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: We often have charity concerts now. The audience willingly attends and donates to the Ukrainian army. Bands also try to perform not only in Ukraine but also beyond its borders. I have seen many announcements of international tours.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: In moments of doubt or creative block, how do you motivate yourselves to push forward and continue creating music?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: We never experience stagnation. If there’s no inspiration for creating new songs, then we perform or record in the studio, laying the groundwork for future concerts abroad, develop new merchandise, and give interviews like we are doing now, for example. But as I mentioned earlier: it’s not us who are moving the band anymore, but the band moving us.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: Looking ahead, what aspirations or goals do you collectively hold for the future of Lethargy?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: We would like to perform abroad. In 17 years, we have never performed in Europe. Will you accept us?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: How do you envision your legacy within the metal community, both in Ukraine and on a global scale?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: After the start of the war, people have become more interested in our country, including its cultural aspects. I hope that our bands will be heard by a larger audience. After all, we all have something to tell you.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Daria \"Aeonia\" Bratu</strong>: Finally, what message do you want to convey directly to your fans?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lethargy UA</strong>: Stay united. Respect each other, we are united by the great power of music. Long live Rock’n’roll!</p>","title":"Exclusive Interview with Lethargy UA: Harmonizing Resilience and Melodic Might","details":"","Socials":"\n<p class='lead'>\n  <a href='https://web.facebook.com/LethargyUA'><i class='bi bi-facebook'></i></a>\n  <a href='https://www.instagram.com/lethargy_ua/'><i class='bi bi-instagram'></i></a>\n  \n  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTsnLMkCsLM'><i class='bi bi-youtube'></i></a>\n</p>","img01":"https://pulse-of-the-underground.com/assets/435569225_813204937499166_5120930457689830732_n.jpg","sub":"gbK4OvgKbyYDfYCfIjboOqjA9Yv1","date":"24/05/2024","lang":"en","translations":{"en":"Exclusive-Interview-with-Lethargy-UA:-Harmonizing-Resilience-and-Melodic-Might.json","el":"ΑποκλειστικήΣυνέντευξημετουςLethargyUA-ΕναρμονίζονταςτηνΨυχικήΔύναμημετηΜελωδική-el.json"},"category":"Interviews"}
