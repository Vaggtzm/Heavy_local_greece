{"content":"<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As temperatures drop, so do the rhythms! Three days ago, on June 14th, the Americans released an album with indigo and earthy yet dystopian colors that appeal both to the eye and the ear! The stoner doomers REZN have come out with \"Burden\" to amaze us this summer! Let's first see who they are!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Who They Are</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">REZN is a four-member band from Chicago, Illinois, USA, formed in 2016 with the goal of playing a blend of psychedelic-stoner doom! The band consists of Rob McWilliams (guitar, lead vocals), Phil Cangelosi (bass, backing vocals), Spencer Ouellette (synth), and Patrick Dunn (drums)!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Since 2016, they have produced significant work as a super-active band (4 full-length albums, 3 collaborations, 2 live albums, and 3 singles)! Let's take a look at the album!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Album</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\"Burden\" was recorded in August 2021 at Earth Analog in Tolono, Illinois, and was entirely processed by Matt Russell and Zach Weeks at God City Studio in Salem, Massachusetts, while the artwork contributions came from Adam Burke of Nightjar Illustration, Spencer Ouellette, and Future Wisdom. The band expressed their eternal gratitude to Matt Talbot, Mike, Matty, Austin, Dean, their families, and all their listeners!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">After 3 years and 3 days, \"Burden\" has been released! The album consists of 7 tracks and lasts 34 minutes and 31 seconds!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Technically, throughout its duration, \"Burden\" has an atmospheric and melodic aura with wonderful elegiac vocals, guitar and bass riffs, while the synths enhance the soundscape, giving it an even more artistic and delicate color, accompanied by saxophone, flute, piano, and rain stick! Particular emphasis is placed on the bass, which holds a prominent position in the compositions throughout the album!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Lyrically, \"Burden\" is a journey through human instinct and the more animalistic side of existence, as well as the concept of death within a symbolic framework around nature, human creativity, mysticism, illusions, and dreams!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Conclusion</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class='lead'>It is an excellent piece of work, a musical feast with various sounds that combine flawlessly and create a very unique soundscape in \"Burden\" with their distinct touch! Hence, it is a well-crafted album that I highly recommend to all our readers!</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class='lead'>Tracklist:</p><p class='lead'><br></p><ol><li>Indigo 04:55</li><li>Instinct 05:25</li><li>Descent of Sinuous Corridors 01:08</li><li>Bleak Patterns 06:52</li><li>Collapse 05:33</li><li>Soft Prey 06:19</li><li>Chasm 04:36</li></ol>","title":"Melodic Sorrow - REZN - Burden (Album Review + band info) ","details":"A wonderful cover artwork του cover of the album, depicting all the elements of nature!","Socials":"\n<p class='lead'>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n</p>","img01":"https://pulse-of-the-underground.com/assets/a2954421661_16.jpg","sub":"QY7GE8irSce3f4AFKW20DAWVxhr2","date":"19/06/2024","lang":"en","translations":{"el":"----REZN---Burden-(Album-Review-+-band-info)-.json","en":"MelodicSorrow-REZN-Burden-AlbumReview-bandinfo--en.json"},"category":"Latest Reviews(GRE)","isReady":true,"written_date":"17/06/2024"}
