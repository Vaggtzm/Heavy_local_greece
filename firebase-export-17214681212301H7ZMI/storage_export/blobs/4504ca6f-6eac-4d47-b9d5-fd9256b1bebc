{"content":"<p class='lead'>Thanks to bands like OOMPH!, Rammstein, Eisbrecher, and Unheilig, who paved the road for the characteristic harsh, dark, yet sometimes playful and upbeat music genre from central Europe known as Neue Deutsche Härte (NDH) in the late 90s and 2000s, a vast number of new bands have formed in the past 20 to 25 years, honoring the genre. It features influences from heavy metal, industrial rock, punk, gothic, Schlager, pop, and electronic music.</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class='lead'>The young band Infektum is just starting their journey with influences from big names such as Metallica, Rammstein, System of a Down, Slipknot, and Depeche Mode, as well as well-known artists from their country of origin, Germany, such as Nina Hagen, Trio, Puhdys, and Kraftwerk. As stated, the band was founded by the rhythm guitarist Philip Geißer and vocalist Stephan Schütt in 2017. The two of them, as kids growing up in the 90s, were highly influenced by the musical choices of their parents.</p><p class='lead'>Infektum puts us in an imaginary setting: in a quiet, warm room with a nice hot drink, a fireplace, and many books of all sorts, while outside the cold winter weather is ravaging. One can let their mind wander and get lost in books, learning about world history, science, or even new, unexplored knowledge territories, but suddenly, loud electronic sounds, wild guitars, and energetic screams echo, piercing the silence. Metal between bookshelves? Such an unlikely combination, but Infektum makes it real with their powerful music and intriguing lyrics, staying loyal to the genre like the huge names did before them.</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class='lead'>They have set a target: to reintroduce Neue Deutsche Härte to younger generations. It's a genre with many versatile musical features derived from metal, techno, classical, and more. A noble cause indeed, which makes me wish that Infektum will spread their wings all over Europe and the world, wielding the power of NDH in their hands.</p>","title":"Infektum: Walking in the Path of Neue Deutsche Härte - A Band Review ","details":"Genre: Neue Deutsche Härte, Location: Berlin, Germany, Year of Formation: 2017","Socials":"<p class='lead'><a href='https://www.facebook.com/share/P5Eqdt9HA6p8dC5D/'><i class='bi bi-facebook'></i></a> <a href='https://www.instagram.com/infektum_official?igsh=MXNydG9kaXB4eHR5cw=='><i class='bi bi-instagram'></i></a> <a href='https://open.spotify.com/artist/6xFflCq31V6Zj5zaPkGAat?si=3T2JJyEzQuy7CQpCTZsZ2g'><i class='bi bi-spotify'></i></a> <a href='https://youtube.com/@infektum_official?si=yw8okJKbSWZy-Y1g'><i class='bi bi-youtube'></i></a></p>","img01":"https://pulse-of-the-underground.com/assets/264x264.jpg","sub":"mmQTo2rdEDZ7YsnpJn15gCuaWz93","date":"28/05/2024","lang":"en","translations":{"en":"Infektum-Walking-in-the-Path-of-Neue-Deutsche-Hrte---a-band-review-.json","el":"Infektum-ΣταΜονοπάτιατηςNeueDeutscheH-rte-ΕπισκόπησηΜπάντας-el.json"},"isReady":true,"category":"Latest Reviews(ENG)"}
