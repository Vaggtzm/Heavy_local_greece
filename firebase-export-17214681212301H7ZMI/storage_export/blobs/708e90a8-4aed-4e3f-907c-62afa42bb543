{"content":"<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In my quest for hidden gems, I believe I have found one of my favorite albums so far from those I've chosen either on my own or through collaboration! Dear readers, today I present to you a special review! This review concerns the album by the Greek prog rock band Forbidden Myth titled Zantea Chronicle! Let's take a look at the album!</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The album</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class='lead'>Zantea Chronicles: The Nightmare Awakens was released just a few days ago and is the result of a collaboration of 9 vocalists and 6 instrumentalists who undertook to carry out a unique project! It consists of 12 tracks and has a duration of 1 hour and 10 minutes, while it is the continuation of Forbidden Myth's debut album of 2021, Zantea Chronicles: The Dream Dominator (20 tracks - 100 minutes)! This is an album characterized by two main features: the absence of electric guitar and electric bass, as a digital and analog Hohner D6 clavinet was used for the rhythm and one of the first string bass simulators of the 60s, the Rheem Kee, aiming to create a retro nostalgic sound of the 70s! Additionally, with the use of acoustic piano, synthesizers such as the Minimoog, Mellotron, electric piano, tape effects, and Theremin, an amazing musical diversity was created, which enriched and complemented the vocal plurality, thus crafting a distinctive timbre that I believe travels far through the ethereal vocals and narrations, accompanied by an orchestral amalgam, from our dimension to a fantastical mystical/occult epic world! A true ode, consequently, to the magical, still analog, decade of the 70s!</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Thematically, Zantea is an adventurous place! Here we will see the story of the humble yet sinful tanner Derolt from the village of Mirandor unfold! Derolt harbors hatred for Sirin, the heroine of the prelude, as his fellow villagers distrust and dislike him due to his past life! Derolt will be deceived in his deep sleep, in the dream dimension of Morpheus, by the lord of the Abyss, Vosar, who entered his mind, making him eat a stone fruit in a stone forest and convincing him that he must free from her cell an ancient queen who does not seem to be as Vosar presents her, exploiting Derolt's hatred for Sirin, telling him that through this queen he will be freed and together they will defeat their common enemy, Sirin! Soon he will wake up and realize that he has the ability to control people's minds! Thus begins his adventure! An adventure in which he will encounter various beings, such as the benevolent Spirit of Dawn, Ovaris, who will try to make him see Vosar's deception, the mystic wizard relative of Jahat, Kasanman, Dibladiel the proud but cursed watchful guardian of Jahat's tomb-prison, and more! Will Derolt manage to escape Vosar's deception? Will he overturn everything and become the long-awaited hero, or will he die, never managing to escape his illusion once Vosar's purpose is fulfilled, which is his own liberation through the queen Jahat, who will serve as his means for the destruction of the last free kingdom of Humans? I know the end, but I won't reveal it! You will find out for yourselves by listening to this marvelous creation, but first having listened to The Dream Dominator to fully grasp the story!</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class='lead'>Conclusion</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class='lead'>An album that goes far beyond the Greek standards! Zantea Chronicle will captivate you! This is certain from a technical and lyrical standpoint! Many congratulations to Hydraulic Records and Forbidden Myth for producing this masterpiece and especially to Antonis Adelfidis, who seems to be the mastermind behind the creation of Zantea Chronicle, but also to all the musicians and sound engineers who worked on this and contributed the most! You are all exceptional!</p><p class='lead'><br></p><p class='lead'>Tracks (70 minutes):</p><ol><li>Overture of Rage 06:56</li><li>The Petrified Forest 05:53</li><li>The Puppet 05:11</li><li>Take a Sip! 05:28</li><li>The Most Precious Gift 05:03</li><li>The Screaming Paradise 04:19</li><li>The Riddle of Hill Myna 06:40</li><li>The Broken Overpass 05:11</li><li>Guard for Eternity 04:59</li><li>The Sword of Doom 07:57</li><li>Back from the Dead 05:17</li><li>Jahat Arisen 07:59</li></ol>","title":"Vosar Strikes Back - Forbidden Myth - Zantea Chronicles: The Nightmare Awakens (Album Review)","details":"","Socials":"\n<p class='lead'>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n</p>","img01":"https://pulse-of-the-underground.com/assets/a0404193695_16.jpg","sub":"QY7GE8irSce3f4AFKW20DAWVxhr2","date":"28/05/2024","lang":"en","translations":{"el":"Vosar-Strikes-Back---Forbidden-Myth---Zantea-Chronicle-The-Nightmare-Awakens-Album-Review.json","en":"VosarStrikesBack-ForbiddenMyth-ZanteaChronicles-TheNightmareAwakens-AlbumReview--en.json"},"isReady":true,"category":"Collabs and Sponsorships","translatedBy":""}
