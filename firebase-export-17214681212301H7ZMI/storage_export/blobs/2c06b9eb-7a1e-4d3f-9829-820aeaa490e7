{"content":"<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The album opens with the track “EARTH”, a slow-burning psych odyssey that immediately transports the listener to vast, arid landscapes. Waterreus’ guitar work is mesmerizing, with languid, spacey riffs that shimmer like heat mirages across a sonic desert. The guitar tones are rich and textured, evoking the rugged beauty of our planet’s most desolate regions.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Meanwhile, the rhythm section lays down a foundation as solid as bedrock.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The drums, with their gentle yet insistent pulse, act as a sherpa, guiding the listener through the winding paths of Waterreus’ open-form guitar heroics.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As the journey progresses, we arrive at “SUN”, the album’s luminous focal point. In this track, the trio captures the intense, primal energy of the sun, our solar system’s vital star. The tempo accelerates, reflecting the sun’s continuous nuclear fusion. Sula’s synthesizers expand and shimmer, their arpeggios flickering like solar flares against a cosmic noise background. Lulu’s bass lines pulsate with unyielding force, echoing the sun’s powerful gravitational pull. Lex’s guitar, now incandescent, peals out searing solos that cut through the mix like beams of light piercing the stratosphere.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The album concludes with “MOON”, a hypnotic trek through lunar soundscapes. The mood shifts to something more ethereal and introspective, reflecting the moon’s association with introspection and subconscious realms. Lulu’s bass becomes more prominent, its deep, resonant tones ebbing and flowing like tidal forces. Lex adopts a more atmospheric approach, his guitar awash in reverb and delay, creating rippling patterns reminiscent of moonlight dancing on a midnight sea. Sula’s keyboard work here is particularly noteworthy, with spectral pads and eerie melodies that evoke the silent, cratered face of our celestial companion.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Throughout “Moonseeds” the interplay between the musicians is organic and intuitive, a testament to their improvisational prowess. The remastering by krautrock luminary Eroc adds a pristine clarity to the mix, allowing each element to shine while preserving the music’s raw, spontaneous energy.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Moonseeds” embarks on an interstellar journey to explore our cosmic significance. Fans of Pink Floyd, Hawkwind, or Can will find this album indispensable, as it exemplifies the enduring spirit of psychedelic exploration. Amidst the era of ephemeral digital singles, “Moonseeds” emerges as a monumental full-length odyssey, inviting listeners to disconnect, unwind, and drift into unexplored psychic realms.</p>","title":"Moonseeds: A Cosmic Journey Through Elemental Soundscapes","details":"In the ever-growing realm of psychedelic and neo-psychedelic music, the newest creation from Lex Waterreus (Seedy Jeezus), alongside ex-Electric Moon members Sula Bassana and Komet Lulu, shines as a stellar masterpiece.
