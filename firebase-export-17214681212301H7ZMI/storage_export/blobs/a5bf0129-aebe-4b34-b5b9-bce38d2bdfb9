Drawing inspiration from the works of Thomas De Quincey and the nightmarish visions of Dario Argento, Innerload’s third album, “Mater Tenebrarum”, a production done in collaboration with the French label “Great Dane Records” beckons the listeners into the realm of “Our Lady of Darkness”. But does this Venetian band truly capture the essence of horror within their music?

Led by the coarse vocals of Marco Cortese, the band embarks on a relentless gallop through themes of addiction, nightmares, and schizophrenia. While the album initially seems familiar, it’s not until the third track, “Asylum”, that we’re ensnared in horror motifs, only to be thrust back into a Soulfly-like stomper.
