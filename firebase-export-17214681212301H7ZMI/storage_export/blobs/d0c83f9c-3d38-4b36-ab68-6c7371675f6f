Directed by Peggy Psarrou, the band reflects on their journey, sharing moments from their personal studio sessions to their biggest gigs.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Given the importance of the track, Vonavibe wanted to do something special and showcase what it is all about. This track emerges as a powerful anthem, embodying the band’s unwavering spirit in the face of adversity. From the first notes, a sense of determination resonates through the driving guitars and thunderous rhythms. The raw energy of Vonavibe’s heavy modern rock sound serves as a fitting backdrop to the lyrical exploration of perseverance and strength. With each verse, the lyrics paint a vivid picture of overcoming obstacles and rising above the fray, offering a message of encouragement to listeners who may be navigating their own trials.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The soaring vocals carry a sense of conviction, delivering the message of hope with passion and sincerity. The chorus, with its anthemic quality, becomes a rallying cry for those who refuse to be defeated by life’s obstacles. The instrumentation, marked by dynamic shifts and powerful melodies, further amplifies the song’s emotive impact, creating an immersive sonic experience that resonates long after the final chords fade.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The song serves as a testament to the band’s resilience, reflecting their own journey of overcoming challenges and emerging stronger. It is a reminder that, even in the darkest moments, hope remains a guiding light, and strength can be found in the echoes of resilience.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Vonavibe opened their archive and selected some of the best shots taken since the band’s inception, both professional and candid, from cameras and cell phones alike. The result is a collage of the band over the past seven years, including footage from rehearsals, soundchecks, concerts, and even personal moments with crew and friends.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Vonavibe started small, performing for an audience of 20, and eventually supported bands like Monster Magnet and Gus G, both in Greece and abroad. This video serves as a personal reminder to rise above life’s challenges. Following Dyon’s accident, the band’s future was highly uncertain, and it took nearly four years for them to make a comeback to the stage.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">John Tass explains that the video serves as an animated depiction of the band and the significance of its name. Vonavibe embodies a sense of hope, representing resilience in the face of challenges. The production and mixing were handled by Dyon at Red Toy Studio, with mastering done by Yannis Christodoulatos at SweetSpot Mastering Studios.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Vonavibe’s new single is a triumph of spirit and sound, a testament to the enduring power of music to inspire, uplift, and unite. “Bleed to Life” stands as a beacon of hope in a world often besieged by uncertainty, reminding us that, with determination and courage, we can weather any storm.</p>","title":"VONAVIBE - New Single and Video for “Vonavibe” from the Upcoming Album “Bleed To Life”","details":"a heavy modern rock  , Athens, Greece","Socials":"<p class='lead'><a href='https://www.facebook.com/Vonavibe'><i class='bi bi-facebook'></i></a> <a href='https://www.instagram.com/vonavibe/'><i class='bi bi-instagram'></i></a> <a href='https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/artist/3ISavG2RhSliWSm0UbM1O5?si=haYKG922QsK24fy1ijZmkA'><i class='bi bi-spotify'></i></a> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG1Fzo-C6xrPB-6ixasH2Jw'><i class='bi bi-youtube'></i></a></p>","img01":"https://pulse-of-the-underground.com/assets/Vonavibe I SMALL.jpg","sub":"bUNTt5SRIbWEJdonT33xi7uDTus1","date":"03/06/2024","lang":"en","translations":{"en":"VONAVIBE---New-Single-and-Video-for-Vonavibe-from-the-Upcoming-Album-Bleed-To-Life.json"},"category":"Collabs and Sponsorships","isReady":true}
