{"content":"<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A futuristic, wild land - Project Renegade - Ultra Terra (album review)</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Summer is on its way and this album brings a cool breeze for the upcoming summer heat! <em>Ultra Terra</em> from Project Renegade, a band from Athens, is here to show that metalcore is going strong! I can truly say that it was a very pleasant listen! Let's see why!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>Ultra Terra</em> is approaching its one year anniversary in two months! It is an album lasting 54 minutes and 51 seconds and consists of 13 tracks!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Technically, it is an extremely well-crafted melodic amalgam of groove, metalcore, heavy and nu metal, with classy riffs, breakdowns and positively unexpected bridges that act as expressive transitions for the meaning that each track wants to convey! Along with them, a modern electronic sound is added, which gives a modern and at the same time futuristic tone, as mentioned in the title! Lastly, it is impossible not to mention the stormy vocals of Marianna, the vocalist of the band, as well as the wonderful ballad of the last track, entitled No Country for White Flags (3:07), which, I have to say, moved and touched me not only because of Marianna’s vocals, but also due to the addition of a piano. I also wish to add that it shook me as the finale of a journey in a strange and interesting land!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Lyrically, summing it up, Ultra Terra is a land far from our own dimension! 54 minutes where references are made to the daily emotional struggle, the yearning for a better tomorrow in a decaying technocratic dystopia, and the darkness of the human soul, to love, jealousy, greed, violence, toxic friendships, conformity, oblivion, guilt, religious fanaticism, depression, and decorum! At least, these are the meanings I found.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Conclusion</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A well-crafted album with many contemporary elements and lyrical polysemy! It is quite entertaining and enjoyable to listen to, and for those looking for music with many meanings, for those who want to look deeper, beyond the orchestration and rhythm! Many congratulations from me to Marianna and the whole line-up, of course!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Tracklist:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><ol><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Critical Mutations (1:33)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">23 (6:21)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Millennial March (5:15)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Apex (3:51)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Fix is In (3:46)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Timewave (4:29)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">My Oath (3:22)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Civil Unrest (4:55)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Token (3:29)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Negative Grey (4:17)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Bloodwitch (4:46)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Ultra Terra (5:34)</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">No Country For White Flags (3:07)</li></ol>","title":"A futuristic, wild land - Project Renegade - Ultra Terra (album review)","details":"","Socials":"\n<p class='lead'>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n</p>","img01":"https://heavy-local.com/assets/SOCIAL.jpg","sub":"QY7GE8irSce3f4AFKW20DAWVxhr2","date":"21/05/2024","translations":{"el":"Μια-φουτουριστική-άγρια-γη---Project-Renegade---Ultra-Terra-(album-review).json","en":"A_futuristic,_wild_land_-_Project_Renegade_-_Ultra_Terra_(album_review)-en.json"},"lang":"en","category":"Collabs and Sponsorships","translatedBy":"uSXH49YHlzT8vjQ94ZuJTOz351m2"}
