                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Could you tell us about the origins of Tortugal Sacrifice
                            and how the band came together?
                        </p>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): I started the band in June of 2022. It was my solo
                            project and I met Tanner, our lead guitarist, in high school, and then I met Luke, our
                            original rhythm guitarist, and then Conner and Cole (who are with us now) and since the
                            original rhythm guitarist parted ways with us we got Evan whom we met through the music
                            scene. So… yeah, that’s pretty much all about how we started the project.

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): What inspired each of you to pursue Death Metal as your
                            main genre?
                        </p>
                        <p className="lead">
                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Tanner Ravazzolo): I used to love the way it sounds. It’s just so
                            brutal! Yeah, I think that’s the word.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Cole Williamson): I love the intensity of it. Death Metal is the best
                            genre.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Evan Wiggins): I, too, love the intensity of it. I have always kinda
                            liked loud guitars and angry people yelling. It was great to listen to that since I was a
                            little kid so it was kinda a natural progression. Like I have started with Foo Fighters and
                            then I have just worked my way into the Metal, searched for every genre and subgenre and
                            fell in love with Death Metal. It’s my favorite genre of Metal. It kicks ass, yeah.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Conner Williamson): Telling the truth, at first I wasn’t a fan, but I
                            have started to like it very much.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): Similar to Evan, my music taste progressed from what
                            my parents listened to (Hard Rock) to Death Metal and Deathcore, the Death Metal sound
                            becoming my favorite sound. I think it is very much a progression for all of us. I don’t
                            think any of us just heard Death Metal and was instantly like “Yeah! This is the genre!”. It
                            takes time to build up, to get into the genre.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>
                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Your debut album, “The Many Faces of Death”, received
                            critical acclaim. What was the inspiration behind the album, and how do you feel it
                            represents the essence of Tortugal Sacrifice?
                        </p>
                        <p className="lead">
                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): I really just recorded the whole thing in my bedroom.
                            It was my first attempt to make any music. A lot of the lyrics are –as you guys wrote
                            already in your article-, about imagining how death feels like and of course, about people
                            having different experiences with it. That’s what I really wanted to focus on, just like…
                            well, for the first album ever I didn’t want to go too far outside of the Death Metal
                            lyrical and style. As I got more comfortable with it, like recording “Arrogance the King”
                            and “Knucklecrusher”, I have started to experiment with different lyrical styles. Yeah, the
                            inspiration –like the lot of it- comes from the past. I don’t wanna say “trauma”, but “past
                            happenings of my life”, I guess.

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): “Arrogance the King” and “Knucklecrusher” are powerful
                            singles that showcase your distinctive sound. Can you walk us through the creative process
                            behind these tracks, speak a bit about what were the major changes you did?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>
                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): Well, yeah. I got better at recording. I think that
                            shows through the singles and I have started to change the way I was writing the lyrics. The
                            way I used to write the lyrics was like this: the writing came to mind while I was hearing
                            the music and I think I realized that I write better when I have a theme or idea. Like with
                            “Arrogance the King”… while writing those lyrics I have decided I am gonna write lyrics
                            about Oedipus Rex and that helped me write more intelligent lyrics or this how I feel like.
                            Now the lyrics are more in-depth ones. I also feel like my work quality has increased and
                            this next EP is going to be even better than the singles just because now we are better at
                            recording and it will be send to a mixing & mastering engineer that we’ve been chatting with
                            to get the professional sounding.

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): As ambassadors of the death metal scene in Canada, how do
                            you perceive the current state of the genre, and what do you envision for its future?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>
                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Tanner Ravazzolo): The metal scene in Canada is just really fantastic!
                            There are so many great bands, so many great people and the bands have all the support they
                            need.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>
                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Are there any emerging artists or trends that excite you
                            within the metal community?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                        <p className="lead">
                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): There are, as Tanner said, a lot of great and noble
                            bands. Some of them are our age, which is great. I can mention Aftershock Overdrive, Iron
                            Cross, and Divine Curse. Yeah, there are a lot of good bands in the local scene. In Ontario,
                            specifically, the movement is very strong. But even going to the East, the Quebec scene is
                            also very strong and it has been like this for many, many years. A lot of very good Death
                            Metal bands are coming from there. All in all, I think it’s a good scene to be a part of. I
                            am excited to see the progress of this thing, to analyze its changes over the years, which
                            bands rise to the top, and which bands remain in the shadows.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>
                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Evan Wiggins): I have seen a lot of really cool bands from all over
                            Ontario. We have a bunch of great bands with friendly people. By now we all know each other
                            pretty well and we all just met each other through the music. That’s pretty cool.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): Yeah, we’ve been into the scene just for a year by
                            now, and we already met so many people like we can form other 10 Death Metal bands. In fact,
                            that is the reason why some of the band members from here are having side projects right
                            now. It is a strong scene, a strong community. It’s really good.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>
                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Your live performances are known for their intensity and
                            energy. Do you have any memorable moments or anecdotes from your time on stage?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): There is a venue where we are playing pretty often,
                            called “Red Papaya” in Guelph, it’s a Thai restaurant during the week they host metal shows
                            on the weekends. We had a lot of really good shows there. We played our first show there and
                            we had over 100 people which is nice for something that is meant to be your first show. And
                            yeah… we played like shit back then ‘cause it was our first show, but people loved it
                            anyway. No one really said a bad word… of course no one really notices when you fuck up on
                            the stage. We also played in The Rockpile Toronto, which is actually a venue where huge
                            names like Led Zeppelin, Alex Cooper performed. Those are really big names in the music
                            history and it was really cool to be on that stage. That was the first professional stage we
                            have ever played on, but I think some of the funniest shows come from Red Papaya, in Guelph,
                            and Dundas and Sons, in London. Dundas and Sons is a really small bar… brewery… it’s a
                            really shithole, but man, it was really fun to be there. People showed up every time.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Conner Williamson): People fucking love it.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): And last we played there, this guy (referring to
                            Conner) got an allergic reaction on stage so I was like… “Cool! We need to do something
                            quickly.”
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Conner Williamson): I was… Actually, we were playing our last song
                            “Banished to the Depths” and the guitarist from the other band called Iron Cross, a band
                            that performed too during that night, came with a sandwich. I can’t eat nutella. And he gave
                            the sandwich to me, there was nutella in it and once we finished our last song I could
                            already tell that I was having an allergic reaction.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): Yeah, so he was having an allergic reaction because
                            he has hazelnut allergy and we drove him to… well, we were about droving him to the
                            hospital, but because he spit it out, instead of swallowing it, it wasn’t that bad so we
                            just drove him to the nearest pharmacy, he got a Benadryl and got well, but fuck! That was…
                            great. That was our fun hour.

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Beyond the studio and stage, what are some individual
                            hobbies that contribute to the unique personalities within the band?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): I don’t have a ton of other interests other than
                            music. I do like to play some videogames, with some friends here and there. I even recorded
                            some parts of my playthroughs, like funny moments from games and I’ll probably put them on
                            Youtube. I do not expect much from it, but I think it’s just fun to do it. It is also fun to
                            go back and see the funny moments. That is kinda like my side project, I guess.

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Conner Williamson): I don’t have many hobbies, as well. I like to hang

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Evan Wiggins): Yeah, I don’t really have a life outside the music.
                            That’s what I do all day: I play music, I listen to music, that’s what I am doing all the
                            time. I don’t know, I like it, it’s pretty fun.

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Cole Williamson): For me, the hobby would be mixing and mastering. I
                            like to make demos, like 30 seconds sounds and then mastering them. That’s what I am doing
                            besides working with the band.

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Tanner Ravazzolo): All I do is playing guitar, really. I just can play
                            guitar for hours.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): Yeah, he really is into that (referring to Tanner).
                            And I think this a very time consuming passion. Everything we, as musicians, do, either is
                            music or is related to it. So that’s a tough question. As a performer, I cannot think of a
                            damn thing besides that.

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Alright. While I am noticing that you have a full
                            schedule, I am also seeing that you are quite prominent and talkative on social media. In an
                            era dominated by streaming and digital platforms, how do you view the role of physical media
                            and merchandise in connecting with your fanbase?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): We always love to chat with our fans, before and
                            after the shows. A lot of guys come to our shows frecquently and thanks to that, many of
                            them became pretty close friends with us. And then on Facebook, Instagram… like I am
                            managing the social media part, there are always messages from fans. I try to respond to
                            them as much as I can ‘cause I think it’s good to have a strong relationship with your fans.
                            As the band grows up, of course, it’s hard to maintain this relationship, but I am trying my
                            best. We got the more exclusive social platforms, like the Patreon, and Instagram channel,
                            so the fans can directly see what’s going on in our lives and you know, simply chat as a
                            friend to a friend. It’s more than chatting as a fan to an artist. And then we also get, of
                            course, sometimes, some fucking weird fans. Yeah, there are some odd fans as well. We love
                            them all.

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): What about Threads? Do you have an account there as well?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): We’re on Threads, too. But we are managing more our
                            Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube accounts. I don’t know, we kinda missed the whole Threads
                            trend when it started. We’re on it, we post on it, but we are not chatting so much there.
                            But now that you have mentioned it, I will probably do it.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Looking ahead, what can fans expect from Tortugal
                            Sacrifice in terms of future releases and performances?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): We’re gonna play some new songs soon and now that we
                            are speaking of this, I must say that the songs we’re about to play would be more technical.
                            We will have a new EP. The new one is a little more Deathcore, like a little more Deathcore
                            than we’ve have in the past. Honestly, I think it is a little split between Death Metal and
                            Deathcore. I think it’s gonna be really good. We are liking the way it’s sounding so far,
                            but yeah… It will be much more heaviness and rawness in general than in the past. And we
                            will play it during the summer. In fact, during the summer we plan to play as much as we
                            can, but while making the EP we won’t have as many shows as in the past just because it
                            takes time and focus.

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Speaking of next gigs, where and when can we see your
                            performances?
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Tortugal Sacrifice (Alex Shellington): Our next show is on February, 17 in Guelph, at “Red
                            Papaya” again and then there will be also some gigs somewhere in Toronto. We didn’t plan
                            much in this regard because we are working our assess off on the EP.
                            <hr className="bg-dark"></hr>

                            Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): I see. Finally, what message would you like to convey to
                            your fans and listeners who continue to support Tortugal Sacrifice on your musical journey?

                            than that. To the fans: thank you for buying our merch, thank you for coming to the shows,
