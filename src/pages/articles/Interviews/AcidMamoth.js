                    1. ACID MAMMOTH is more likely a family gathering and a strong musical bonds above all but we would love to know more of How did the band come together, Have there been any significant setbacks or obstacles you've faced as a band, and how did you overcome them?
                    <br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
Hi, Rawya! Thank you for this interview! I and our bassist formed the band in 2015. We have been friends for more than fifteen years, we are pretty much brothers, and we have been playing music together long before Acid Mammoth were formed. We formed the band because of our love for slow, heavy riffs, which we loved jamming together. It wasn’t long before my dad joined the band on guitar duty, and shortly after that, our drummer Marios. We’ve been together ever since. The line-up being comprised by the same four people has helped the band a lot in the shaping of our sound and the overall consistency from album to album. As for setbacks and obstacles, every band has had to face some, as they are part of everyday life. Thankfully, so far we haven’t faced an obstacle or setback to which there wasn’t a solution. No matter what might come up, we always strive to overcome it, we work together and we continue going forward. If I had to pick one obstacle, the covid pandemic was definitely a huge thorn on our side, as it put us on ice when it came to playing shows for two years. Thankfully these dark days seem to be in the past, and we can enjoy playing shows and interacting with people, hanging out together and having fun.
<br></br>
<br></br>
2. “Acid UnderHoof” was a blast of a release, as it has been noticed as the most streamed song. We would love to know how these strong riffs come out so true and emotionally attach the listener into the abyss of THE MAMMOTH SPIRIT GUIDANCE and the themes that your band explores in your songs.
<br></br>
<br></br>
The lyrics of “Them!” are pretty straightforward. A witchy ritual is taking place on top a misty mountain, where unholy beings gather dance around the fire, calling for someone evil. The narrator is among them, terrified of what’s unfolding right in front of his eyes. It’s about the idea of being helpless against the claws of evil. The narrator is merely a passive spectator, unable to act and unable to deal with what is in front of them. They see evil unfold in front of their eyes and they are unable to escape it. For the riff itself, I think insane amounts of fuzz makes it sound threatening!
<br></br>
<br></br>
3. “Caravan” was a super successful, hypnotic album release. It has left a significant mark on many people in the scene, which is very impressive. How would you describe the experience of arranging and starting to record the songs? How challenging was it? And what were the most inspiring and creative factors that pushed you to pursue such a masterpiece release during very tough and challenging conditions worldwide?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Thank you for your kind words. While we absolutely love "Caravan" and how the final product turned out, its production was a nightmare due to the obstacles I mentioned earlier, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic. Composing the songs and recording them was easy and lots of fun because Athens had just opened after its first lockdown. However, as soon as we finished recording and got ready for mixing, Athens fell into lockdown once again, and we were stranded in our homes, unable to mix the album in the studio. As a result, we had to mix it from afar, and the process wasn't as smooth as we would have liked. It brought the desired results, sure; we love how the album sounds, in fact, it sounds exactly like we intended, but we weren't all there at the studio during its mixing and mastering to fully enjoy the process. The album overall reflects our mood during that time, and it's more melancholic as a result. We were depressed, not being able to play live, not being able to see each other for a long period of time; therefore, the album exhibits our feelings. It is more melodic and more depressing than its predecessor for sure.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Black Sabbath was the beginning for all of us. It was the band that introduced us to this magical world of music. This heavy, sometimes dark and yet always jammy atmosphere that Black Sabbath exhibit is one that totally enchanted us from the very beginning and heavily shaped the way we compose and play music. Our plan since the beginning was to gather in a rehearsal space and jam Sabbathy tunes together, and the whole thing evolved into what you hear on the records.
<br></br>
<br></br>
5. Can you share some insights into the process of recording and producing your music to achieve that Acid Mammoth signature sound?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Dionysis Dimitrakos, our sound engineer, is the man behind our sound in the records. He is a friend we’ve known since we were teenagers, and he knows our sound so well that he can predict exactly what we want before we can even put it into words. He always manages to capture the essence of our sound, the essence of what the band wants to sound like. At the same time, I guess orange amps have a big part in how we sound. Generally, while we use a lot of pedals, when it comes to the essence of our sound, we let the guitar and the amp do most of the work, alongside a hellish amount of fuzz, and afterwards we apply certain effects as a cherry-on-top. We play a simplistic kind of doom that doesn’t require a lot of effects and psychedelia. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
6. How do you navigate the balance between staying true to the core of Sabbath Spirit while also innovating and incorporating new elements into your music to establish your proper MAMMOTH signature?
<br></br>
<br></br>
After a while, it comes off naturally. While our music isn’t something completely new that hasn’t been heard before, we strongly believe that it’s an authentic take on doom. We are proud of our Sabbath influences, as they have helped us discover our own identity and sound through them. Usually there is no navigation in order to find a balance. We just don’t think about it. When we write a new song, we never have the mindset of whether it needs to sound like something else or not, we simply start playing and everything comes off naturally. After the song has been composed, we have certain ideas on it and changes. We either expand on it, or make changes and additions. It’s a rewarding and creative process.
<br></br>
<br></br>
7. Your latest release, the last album, has been described as a sunken journey through the abyss. I noticed a slight different texture in the atmosphere. Its bluesy undertones add a soulful, emotive quality, weaving through the music with a gritty yet smooth texture that speaks of both hardship and resilience. Can you tell us about the creative process behind this project? We are super excited to have visibility over another banger release!
<br></br>
<br></br>
In contrast to “Caravan”, this new album was composed and recorded in between touring. Even during the recordings, we’d fly all around Europe to play shows, and return back to Athens to resume the album’s production. As a result, all the energy and excitement we gathered while playing live was transmitted into the new record. We recorded songs that we felt we’d love playing live, and I feel like we have succeeded in that regard. We wanted to record heavy hitting, insanely fuzzy behemoth songs that retain everything our sound is about, but take it a step further, like a level-up. “Supersonic Megafauna Collision” in essence is a celebration of all things heavy and fuzzy.  
<br></br>
<br></br>
8. How do you approach songwriting in terms of capturing the dark, heavy atmosphere characteristic of the MAMMOTH music?
<br></br>
<br></br>
We love watching old-school horror films, from the birth of cinema all the way to the 90s. Watching these movies quite often gives us the atmosphere and aesthetic we need to pick up our instruments and write something doomy. The emotion, the horror and the overall vibe of old school horror movies has inspired our song writing in a major way. Other than movies, we simply sit and talk, or we don’t say a single word and instead just pick up our instruments and play. We’ve played so much together that writing something dark and heavy almost comes naturally.
<br></br>
<br></br>
9. Your tours were absolutely electrifying, leaving audiences in awe and craving more at every turn. It's clear that every moment was well-deserved and meticulously crafted. What has been the most rewarding moment in your career as the MAMMOTH FAMILY so far, and why?
<br></br>
<br></br>
We had a show somewhere in Germany, and a person approached us with all of our records -every single vinyl color of every record- and asked us to sign them. He told us that he had driven over 600 km from another country just to see us play. That was the most rewarding moment I think. If what we do is so special to someone, even to one person, then we are content. We feel that what we have done has some meaning and it’s not just us four having fun with our music. Touring is always an amazing experience because you meet so many people, each and every one of them interesting and special in their own way.
<br></br>
<br></br>
10. Your album covers and typography often feature intricate and dark artwork that complements your music perfectly. Can you tell us about the creative process behind designing and selecting the artwork for your albums, and how important do you think album artwork is in conveying the essence of your music to your listeners?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Music and artwork go hand in hand. We work with Branca Studio for all of our artworks, from T-Shirt designs all the way to our album covers. We feel that he has greatly captured the essence and themes of our music and is able to visually represent it in a beautiful way, portraying this primal vintage horror aesthetic in each one of our records. His artworks scream “what you are going to listen to in this record is heavy”. Had the album covers been designed by someone else, we feel that the band would have a very different aesthetic. We can’t imagine a universe where we release an album without him making the cover. Generally, we always like working with the same people over and over again. Same band members, same record label, same artist for the artworks, same sound engineer for the albums, same rehearsal studio, etc. We want to build a team of people we trust and appreciate, and enjoy the entire creative process together.
<br></br>
<br></br>
11. Lastly, what advice would you give to emerging stoner doom bands looking to make their mark in the music industry?
Sure thing. While there is no single “right way” of working your way up as a new band, here is how we think you should operate in your first steps: First and foremost, you should have fun doing it. If you really love what you are doing and genuinely enjoy it, chances are that someone else will too. Also, at first, you shouldn’t stress too much over getting expensive gear, or getting as many pedals as possible immediately. Your primary focus should be writing awesome songs that you would love listening to, and the gear will gradually come, to make them sound even better. Invest in songwriting, and in the process you will discover your sound. You should also work with people with whom you are on great terms with, people you love being around. Become a good team and hang out a lot, even outside the band setting. Become a family, so that even if the musical endeavor does not reach the desired results, which we really hope it does, you are left with a great relationship and memories shared with people you love.
Thanks for the interview Rawya. Wishing you all the best!
