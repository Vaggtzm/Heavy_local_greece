                    Holler Band, the dynamic musical force born from the ashes of Eldritch, unveils their highly anticipated debut album, “Reborn”. With a fusion of classic rock nostalgia and modern sensibilities, Holler redefines the genre landscape, delivering an electrifying sonic experience that resonates with audiences worldwide. Led by the incomparable Terence Holler, the band’s genesis traces back to a pivotal moment of separation, igniting a journey of introspection and renewal. Following a storied career with Eldritch, Terence took a hiatus to refocus, eventually joining forces with Denis and Matteo Chimenti, laying the foundation for a new musical odyssey. Later on, Leonardo Peruzzi (bass) and Alex Gasperini (drums) joined the band, marking a significant evolution in their sound and dynamics. In 2023, their collective efforts culminated in a harmonious fusion of talent, propelling the band towards new heights of creativity and expression.

                    <br></br>
                    Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Hail, and well met! To kick things off, could you shed some light on how Holler band was formed and what inspired all of you to start this new musical venture?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence): Hi!! Nice to meet you! Well, after my separation from Eldritch (which I co-founded in 1991) in 2022, I took a one year break from music business, just to set up my mind. 32 years in a band, with 13 albums and tours worldwide, really squeezed my brain! In early 2023 I met Denis (guitars) and Matteo Chimenti (keyboards) with the intent to create a rock band. Matteo had a bunch of songs in the drawer but with no vocal lines ever written. It was pretty easy for me to write down the melodies and the lyrics. This is how it all started!! We all love the 80’s style rock and in the end everything came naturally.  Later on Leonardo Peruzzi (bass) and Alex Gasperini (drums) joined the band and in late 2023 we finished recording the 13 songs that became "Reborn".
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): What do you think is the greatest strength of the band when it comes to creating music together?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence): The strength comes from the common taste in music! We all love the same stuff, which is a huge range of genres. We all like any kind of music, even totally away from rock/hard rock/metal/ AOR. I was quite surprised in the chemistry within the band.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Collaboration seems to be a significant aspect of your band dynamic. How do you navigate different creative ideas and personalities within the group to ensure a cohesive sound?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  As I said, we are lucky that we flow all in the same direction. No big problems or discussions about the songs.  I mean, Matteo wrote the 90% of the music and I wrote all the lyrics and vocal lines. The songwriting process was more a duo thing. Thank God the other guys jumped in without creating any kind of problem. We’re lucky in this.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): With the spotlight on your debut album “Reborn”, let’s delve into its creation. Could you begin by sharing the journey behind crafting this masterpiece?
In your recent announcement about "Reborn”, you mentioned having gone through some difficult years and how this new career has given you a sense of rebirth. How has this journey impacted the dynamic of the band and influenced the creative process behind the album?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  Well, I write only if I got something to say. Everything you hear in the songs is a piece of my life, my thoughts and my feelings. Most of the songs talk about love… my Achilles’ ankle!! My life’s been full of issues, most of them are about love and all the shit that it brings! For the first time in my entire music career I wrote everything without thinking! No sitting around a table to decide about what direction to take. This was awesome!! I was used to writing songs with my previous band following a certain kind of mood and direction. This time it was really a new emotion for me! A real rebirth!!
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): “Reborn” marks a significant shift in your musical direction from Eldritch to a more classic rock-inspired sound. What prompted this evolution, and how do you feel this new direction reflects your artistic growth and aspirations?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence): Yes, you’re right! It was a complete shift! It was a normal evolution, as I said before, nothing was planned. This is the music I’ve always listened to in my youth in Brooklyn. I grew up with the radio hits in the 70’s and 80’s and this influenced my whole life. Even if I sang in a metal band for more than 30 years, it didn’t make me become a metal screamer! I’ve always been deeply influenced by melodic rock. This helped my previous band to sound different than the other bands of the same genre (progressive metal) and consequently create a unique sound and fanbase. Same thing now, Holler don’t sound like the other AOR bands because of me!! Ah, ah, this doesn’t mean it’s a good thing, but that’s how it is!
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): The opening track, “Do You Believe” sets a powerful tone for the album. Can you delve into the themes and emotions behind this song, and how it reflects the overall message of “Reborn”?

<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  “Do You Believe” is just one of the typical episodes of my shitty experiences in love!! Sometimes I really feel in the right mood for a serious relationship but there’s something that always happens and ruins my plans!! In this tune I am asking a girl to let herself go and become part of my life... The result?? No way!!!

<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): “Into Me Forever”, “Those Eyes” and “Falling Apart” offer listeners a range of emotions. How do you approach conveying personal experiences and emotions through your music, and what role do you see music playing in connecting with your audience?

<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  To be honest, I really don’t think about nothing while I’m songwriting. I’m like in trance, just me, the words, the melodies, the feelings... I just do whatever I feel like. The music we write is perfect for making my mind travel through a bunch of different issues that happened in my life from day one till nowadays...
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): “Yulia” serves as a poignant tribute to lost love. Can you discuss the significance of this song and how it fits into the overarching narrative of “Reborn”?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  Well, this song is really important to me. It’s all about a girl I really love but is unreachable. There’s a kind of magic in her eyes and even though in my life I had many girls, she is probably the only one that really broke into my heart... Too bad and too sad we’ll never become a couple... This is one of the most important losses in my life after my dad’s passing..... I can’t get her off of my mind even if I’m going out with other women, but my heart belongs to Yulia... The other girls probably hate her!! It fits in “Reborn” because it’s reality, like the whole album talks about.

<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Can you share any significant challenges or breakthrough moments you encountered during the creation of “Reborn”, and how did these experiences shape the final outcome of the album?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  Nothing different than usual happened during the creation of the album. My life is quite the same since the last 30 years... Love that comes and goes, depression, sadness for losses and sometimes some infrequent joys....
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): The album cover of “Reborn” exudes a sense of modernity and energy, with its vibrant colors and Cyberpunk aesthetic. How do you believe this visual representation complements the sonic experience of the album, and what message or atmosphere were you aiming to convey to your audience through this artwork?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  Luca Zironelli did the artwork and this guy is fuck’n awesome!!! The cover represents exactly the mood and the era of "Reborn"... 80’s, but modern.... Our style is quite different than the rest of AOR bands, we got some pieces of originality and different influences.... I think it’s a perfect artwork!! No special message though, just the instinct and the reality of a man’s new life.... A rebirth...

<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): We, too, believe it’s a perfect artwork, one that represents Holler’s clear message. As Holler progresses and develops as a band, what are your aspirations or objectives for the future?


<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  We already almost finished the basic songwriting for the second album!! Our aspiration is to increase the quality of the songs and arrangements and of course, to make the Holler band get bigger!!! We deserve our piece of the pie of world’s music business!!
<br></br>
<br></br>
Heavy Local Greece (Daria Aeonia): Finally, is there a message you’d like to convey directly to your fans?
<br></br>
<br></br>
Holler Band (Terence):  Well, yeah. We’d like to become a big rock band and of course, this could be possible if everybody who gets in touch with our music, spreads the word!!!  Holler is here to kick some serious ass!! Just give it an ear!
