    "content": "<p class='lead'>“Caravan” is not a mere echo of past glories but a bold proclamation of artistic evolution. Clocking in at a succinct 40 minutes, the album embodies the very essence of doom metal, forsaking the trappings of stoner rock that previously hindered their sonic exploration. Foremost amongst the album's virtues are the colossal guitar riffs that serve as the foundation of its soundscapes. Where Under Acid Hoof hinted at their potential, Caravan unleashes it in full force. The guitars, imbued with a palpable sense of heft and adorned in layers of fuzz, weave a tapestry of sound both haunting and hypnotic.</p> <img class='img-fluid' src='https://heavy-local.com/assets/AcidMammoth_main.jpg' /> <p class ='lead'>Yet, it is not solely the instrumentation that elevates “Caravan” to towering heights. The vocalist, Babalis, while still evoking shades of Ozzy Osbourne, asserts his own identity more confidently. His delivery adds a sinister edge to tracks like the menacing opener, “Berserker” and the sprawling epic, “Caravan” where his voice intertwines seamlessly with the labyrinthine guitar melodies.Each track on “Caravan” unfurls like a journey into the abyss, with highlights such as “Psychedelic Wasteland” and the titular opus showcasing Acid Mammoth's prowess in crafting monolithic soundscapes that transcend the mundane. Even the weaker moments, exemplified by the somewhat derivative “Ivory Towers” fail to diminish the album's overall impact. The crowning jewel of “Caravan”  undoubtedly lies in its eponymous epic, an 11-minute odyssey that encapsulates everything the band stands for. From its infectious chorus to its labyrinthine guitar solos, this track exemplifies the sheer magnitude of Acid Mammoth’s sonic ambition. </p> <p class='lead'>Final words: “Caravan” stands as a testament to the enduring power of doom metal. While not without its minor flaws, it is a triumph of atmosphere and intensity, reaffirming Acid Mammoth’s position as torchbearers of the genre. With this album, they have not only surpassed their previous efforts but have also carved out a niche for themselves in the pantheon of modern doom metal.Acid Mammoth has also the albums “Acid Mammoth”, “Under Acid Hoof”and “Supersonic Megafauna Collision”. The next tour will be in April, 2024, according to the band’s official Facebook page.  </p>" ,
