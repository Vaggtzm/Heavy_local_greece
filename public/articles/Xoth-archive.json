    "content": "<p class='lead'>I was browsing Bandcamp, scouting for talented bands of our generation, when I crossed paths with Xoth and their newest work, Exogalactic. I was immediately drawn to the sci-fi imagery in deep blue adorning their album cover, like a true sci-fi nerd I am - I must say that such themes are totally cheese treats for rat traps to me! Even though I checked out their oldest works and loved them, I think that Exogalactic stands out to me the most.</p><p class='lead'>Upon pushing the play button on the very first song 'Reptilian Bloodsport', I was immediately hit with a powerful, menacing riff that really felt like it came from outer space. Then came the thunderous blastbeats, the vocals that were shifting as quick as sound can get, the melodies that felt so alien and pompous. The exciting, dynamic choruses put the listener in the mood for adventure, battles, traveling among the cosmos.   Similar to the music, the very well written and poetic lyrics are of epic galactic wars, legendary weapons, unusual invasive species with malicious plans, an explosion of worldbuilding and references to H. P. Lovecraft's lore, becoming a testament to the culture of sci-fi.All I can say is that I could listen to this album all the time, over and over, stepping into the vast world of dark fantasy, aliens, otherworldly epic tales and whatever else comes with it. It is the guaranteed perfect ~40' for every space fantasy lover. Before closing, I would like to say that Xoth has evolved into a unique sound, blending extreme metal subgenres in a harmonic composition with slight hints of power metal, that add an interesting dynamic to the already original style that they bring to our tables. I am sure that they will blow up on their own, as they are such a promising young band, but I will put my two cents for that as well, as it is very worth it. All in all, if you want to be enchanted by the spells of a distant universe, listen to Exogalactic, and Xoth overall. Stay Metal, my friends </p> " ,
